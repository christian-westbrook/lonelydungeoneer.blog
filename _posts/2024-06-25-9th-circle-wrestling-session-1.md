Hail, and well met!

I use this space to document my solitary travels through the infinite worlds of tabletop roleplaying games. This blog captures session one of *9th Circle of Wrestling*, where I'm using the Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e to run a Living Promotion from the World Wide Wrestling Roleplaying Game!

This is a fairly detailed actual play. If you're new to the hobby, I want you to know that this level of detail is far from the typical notetaking that occurs during a solo roleplaying session. These actual plays are recorded in this format for entertainment purposes only. Please don't feel compelled to spell everything out like I have, or even to take notes at all while playing!

I sincerely hope you enjoy this pairing of the original solo roleplaying system with its first official solo adventure module. Now, let's dive into the actual play! Happy delving, and **fight on!!**
