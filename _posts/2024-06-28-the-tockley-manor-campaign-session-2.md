Hail, and well met!

I use this space to document my solitary travels through the infinite worlds of tabletop roleplaying games. This blog captures session one of *The Tockley Manor Campaign*, where I'm using [Mythic Roleplaying](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/16173/mythic-role-playing?affiliate_id=3556094) to run the solo adventure module The Secret of Tockley Manor as first published in the Mythic Magazine article [Solo Adventure Modules](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/394527/mythic-magazine-compilation-2?affiliate_id=3556094)!

This is a fairly detailed actual play. If you're new to the hobby, I want you to know that this level of detail is far from the typical notetaking that occurs during a solo roleplaying session. These actual plays are recorded in this format for entertainment purposes only. Please don't feel compelled to spell everything out like I have, or even to take notes at all while playing!

I sincerely hope you enjoy this pairing of the original solo roleplaying system with its first official solo adventure module. Now, let's dive into the actual play! Happy delving, and **fight on!!**

# Session 2

When we last left Alan Hexley, an FBI agent assigned to unraveling the mystery behind a small town murder, he was stepping out of a black, four-door sedan into the cold rain in front of the Closport Police Station. Of course, it probably feels like a bit of a stretch calling this the police station, given that this is clearly a repurposed old store front.

Let's set the scene a bit.

>It's drizzling as Alan shuts the driver-side door of the sedan and approaches the store-front-turned-police-station.

How busy is it today at the Town Square?

```
Is it very busy today at the Town Square?

Fate Question
Odds: 50/50
CF: 5

Roll under: 50
d100 = 59, No
```

So there's really no one around as Alan approaches the station. I'm imagining that the station is like something you'd find on any Main Street in the United States.

> Crossing the sidewalk to the building, Alan is greeted by large glass windows and a glass door, originally meant to display merchandise for onlookers. The Closport Police logo is emblazened on the door.

This makes me think that Alan can see pretty clearly into the station and get an idea of what it looks like on the inside before ever opening the door. What does he see?

```
Does the inside look like mostly open space?

Fate Question
Odds:  Likely
CF: 5

Roll under: 75
d100 = 40, Yes
```

This gives me a good idea about what to expect here.

> Alan pauses as he places one hand on the door, looking in through the window. He notices a wooden floor and a single large room, mostly empty.

I wonder if the Chief of Police is here, potentially meeting with someone else in this large room? Alan would surely be able to see them from outside the door if so.

```
Does Alan see anybody standing in the open room through the glass?

Fate Question
Odds: Unlikely
CF: 5

Roll under: 35
d100 = 33, Yes! Random Event!
```

Wow, okay, this is interesting! So Alan does indeed notice that there's already someone inside the Police Station, but we've also triggered our first Random Event of the campaign by rolling doubles! 

Most of the action in a Mythic Adventure is guided by our expectations, whether they're being met or subverted, but any time we roll doubles at or under the Chaos Factor we'll trigger a Random Event, allowing Mythic to throw something at us from beyond our expectations. This is a core mechanic that adds so much to the fun of solo roleplaying! 

Let's see it in action as we randomly determine what happens next. The first step is to determine the Random Event Focus by rolling on the Event Focus Table. This will give us a sense of what the Random Event affects.

```
Random Event Focus
d100 = 007, Remote Event
```

So the next thing that happens is a Remote Event! Alan is somehow going to learn of an event that has already taken place, rather than witnessing it himself. In the next step we roll for a word pair on the Event Meaning tables to randomly determine what happened in this Remote Event.

```
Event Meaning Table
d100 = 24, Desert
d100 = 70, Extravagance
```

This gives me a potentially alarming idea. Let's ask the Oracle to test it.

```
Is there a bag filled with cash behind whoever is talking?

Fate Question
Odds: 50/50
CF: 5

Roll under: 50
d100 = 59, No
```

Okay cool, that would have been wild! I'll go with my next idea, then, but I have some Fate Questions to ask before diving into the narrative.

```
Is this a police officer speaking to a regular townsperson?

Fate Question
Odds: Very likely
CF: 5

Roll under: 85
d100 = 04, Exceptional Yes
```

An exceptional result! So not only is the police officer speaking to one person, but they're actually speaking with a whole group of people!

>...mostly empty, except for a police officer in uniform and several other apparently civilian individuals standing in a loose huddle, clearly speaking excitedly.
>
>Alan notices the officer holding out something strange in one hand, the group examining it.

Let's ask the Oracle some questions about this strange object, the subject of our Remote Event.

```
Is the object white?

Fate Question
Odds: 50/50
CF: 5

Roll under: 50
d100 = 54, No

How about black?

Fate Question
Odds: Likely
CF: 5

Roll under: 75
d100 = 34, Yes
```

And now let's bring Alan inside to learn more about what's going on and to reveal the stange item narratively!

> Alan pulls the door, stepping inside. The group, five people total by the looks of it, collectively turn their heads to address the newcomer.
>
> The Officer's eyes light up in recognition.
>
> Officer: "Hexley! You must be Alan Hexley!"
>
> The Officer, to the rest of the room, importantly: "This is the FBI agent I was telling you all about! Things are getting serious around here, now!"
>
>
