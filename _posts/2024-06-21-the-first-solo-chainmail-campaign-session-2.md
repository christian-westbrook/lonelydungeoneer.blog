*New to the campaign? Here's a link to [Session 1]({% post_url 2024-06-13-the-first-solo-chainmail-campaign-session-1 %})!*

Hail, and well met!

I use this space to document my solitary travels through the infinite worlds of tabletop roleplaying games. This blog captures session two of *The First Solo Chainmail Campaign*, where I'm using the [Mythic Game Master Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422929/mythic-game-master-emulator-second-edition?affiliate_id=3556094) to run an entirely solo [Original Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/28306/od-d-dungeons-dragons-original-edition-0e?affiliate_id=3556094) actual play using [Chainmail](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/17010/chainmail-rules-for-medieval-miniatures-0e?affiliate_id=3556094) to resolve combats!

This is a fairly detailed actual play. If you're new to the hobby, I want you to know that this level of detail is far from the typical notetaking that occurs during a solo roleplaying session. These actual plays are recorded in this format for entertainment purposes only. Please don't feel compelled to spell everything out like I have, or even to take notes at all while playing!

I sincerely hope you enjoy this collision of a modern solo roleplaying system with the original fantasy roleplaying game. Now, let's dive into the actual play! Happy delving, and **fight on!!**

# Session 2

When we last left Grünfeld, he was sitting in a dwarf's farmhouse kitchen trying to land a kobold removal job. Jaddoc, a former sapper (combat engineer) turned cattle rancher, is letting Grünfeld in on exactly what went down before he started looking for outside help. Now that I'm thinking about it, let's add this situation as our first Thread to the Threads List! In the same way that the Characters List provides Mythic with fuel for generating Random Events related to characters, the Threads List fuels Mythic with goals that can be used later to form Random Events that will help or hinder said goals.

```
Threads List
1-2 Land a kobold removal job from Jaddoc
```

We're randomly generating the backstory for Jaddoc's kobold situation using the Creating Compelling Backstories rules from [Mythic Magazine Compilation #2](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/394527/mythic-magazine-compilation-2?affiliate_id=3556094). As a reminder, we're rolling on the Backstory Focus Table until we either roll the Complete result or until we've rolled seven times. Each result becomes context for a string of events telling the story behind Jaddoc's kobold incursion.

The first event we rolled was a New Thread with the word pair Flee, Investment. This pair led me to imagine that someone was out in the pastures working the cows when *something* forced them to abandon the herd they were driving. A Fate Question revealed that it was Jaddoc himself in the field on that day, but then something really exciting happened: we triggered the first Random Event of the campaign! Let's kick off the session by resolving it now!

To summarize, the current context is a flashback to Jaddoc working with his cows in the fields at the moment when something happened that forced him to flee, leaving his herd behind.

```
Random Event Focus
d100 = 95, Current Context

Discover Meaning, Actions
d100 = 61, Misuse
d100 = 9, Building
```

Okay, so while Jaddoc was out with the cows, he caught kobolds raiding a barn and trying to lead cows away! I'm assuming that he owns so many cows that they're organized into different groups. This Random Event pairs perfectly with the current Backstory Event we're working on.

```
Does Jaddoc have several barns spread across his property?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 6 = 13 + 4 = 17, Yes
```

That was really close to being our first exceptional yes,  but I'll settle for just a yes. This tells me that Jaddoc could have been nearer to the edge of his slice of the hex and is potentially pretty far away from his house.

```
Did the kobolds spot him?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 1 = 11 + 2 = 13, Yes

Did they attack Jaddoc?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 +0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 2 = 9, No

Was this initial contact very long ago? Maybe like a month or two ago?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 6 + 5 = 11 + 1 = 12, Yes

Did Jaddoc come across kobolds later in the evening, maybe near Sundown?
```

Both Chainmail and OD&D describe kobolds as struggling to see and fight in full daylight, so I think it's almost a sure thing that kobolds would have waited until dusk before raiding farmlands.

```
Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 2 = 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

Now that Jaddoc is telling us an entire story, just for fun, let's roll for his personality traits.

```
Discover Meaning, Character Personality
d100 = 59, Leader
d100 = 94, Tolerant
```

This result makes sense given Jaddoc's position of leadership over a farming and ranching operation. I'll roll these results into the dialogue I imagine from Jaddoc.

> Jaddoc: “It'll be, let's see now, two months ago tomorrow, actually, that I was out herdin’ the cowsies ‘n’ we saw somethin’ funny going on at the northeast barn. 
>
> The barn doors were wide open 'fore we ever got there, and on the approach we noticed the cattle being led away by a group of, well, somethings! We weren't quite sure what they were at that point. 
>
> I was furious, o’ course, and we started rushin’ that way, but the little buggers started screeching and fired what I can only presume was a shot o’ warning. We heard the clanging of crossbows followed by the whistlin' of bolts, sounds that I couldn't mistake even if I wanted to, but it all fell well short of us 'n' we hightailed it outta there. My cowsies scrambled as we fled, but the kobolds managed to nab several more of 'em.”

Being from the south and having worked with cattle myself, I am seriously enjoying writing this cringe dialogue from Jaddoc the ranching dwarf's perspective.

![Image of cow thievery]({% link docs/assets/cow-thievery.png %})

An interesting aspect of the rules from Generating Compelling Backstories is that your Backstory includes its own temporary lists of Threads and Characters considered to be separate from your adventure's lists. I'll add a new Thread to our Backstory Threads List to account for the kobold's mission here.

```
Backstory Threads List
1-2 Kobolds: Steal Jaddoc's cattle
```

Let's move on now to the second backstory event. I'll roll again on the Backstory Focus Table and then Discover Meaning (roll for a word pair) on the Actions table to find out what happened next.

```
Backstory Event Focus
d100 = 87, Complete!
```

Just kidding! It looks like our backstory ends here, so I'll spend a few moments tying up loose ends with Fate Questions.

```
Did Jaddoc and his ranch hands scout the barn after fleeing to discover that the raiders were kobolds?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 9 + 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, Yes
```

This especially makes sense if the kobolds were too focused on their goal of stealing food to pursue the fleeing farmers.

> Jaddoc: "Once we realized that it wasn't us, but the cattle rather, that the little figures were chasin', we crested a hill and tried to get a good look at 'em."

Neither OD&D nor Chainmail describes or visualizes kobolds. In fact, each lumps kobolds together closely with goblins, for which no textual description of appearance is given, but we do, however, have access to art portraying a goblin in OD&D! You'll find a brief history of goblin art over the years in a recent [Grognardia blog post](https://grognardia.blogspot.com/2024/06/a-very-partial-pictorial-history-of_01836066687.html) if you're interested.

![goblin](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF_iP1qR4aGkoF6y6l0x-FN6kZ5sVPTvhFbT0ZQCtgvX8ZNR0QskiyfjaBotKkqN_krokDXTSYoL96Au6qfkLZBe3UVJ9w8tH61Q0NPE_bW8gPJNvgYyWFHIRPdGDBO80ORRjXiGgGt-mGgMj_rv-emobzoj_AiGefMXPqawNF73p1inkHNin__6YhMWgC/s16000/oddgoblin.jpg)

Goblins appear very similarly to dwarves in the implied setting, and kobolds here can be inferred to be a smaller form of goblin. We can actually use Fate Questions to allow the Oracle to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about kobolds in this particular fantasy universe.

```
Are kobolds just smaller goblins?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 5 + 4= 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

As an aside, notice here that we've never ended the original scene. I'm treating this backstory as something Jaddoc is remembering while sitting with Grünfeld.

Because I've played [RuneScape](https://play.runescape.com/runescape) for most of my life, I usually envision goblins as being little green warlike creatures, similar in look and feel to orcs. Let's check to see if they're green in this universe.

```
Are goblins and kobolds green?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 10 = 20 + 1 = 21! Yes
```

This is an interesting Fate Check example because we rolled above the Exceptional Yes range of 18-20. The odds pushed our result one number past the exceptional range, leaving us with a regular Yes rather than with an Exceptional Yes. We can infer, then, that our goblin and kobold friends are indeed shaded green. 

As another aside, there's a really good chapter on D&D and Chauvinism touching on the tendency of early roleplaying games to characterize adventurers as conquerors and enemy creatures as natives in the book [Muster: A Primer for War](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/413382/muster?affiliate_id=3556094). OD&D employs an alignment system that paints a fairly distinct "us vs. them" situation. Old school OD&D campaigns evolved from wargames where factions are clearly defined, but roleplaying games enable enriching deviation.

Kobolds are aligned with Chaos. It's important to note that OD&D doesn't separate Lawful from Good and Chaos from Evil, so in this universe chaotic creatures can, for all intents and purposes, be considered evil. We will, of course, test these expectations from time to time using Mythic to allow for deviations from the standard.

> Jaddoc: "They looked like ruddy goblins to us from up on the hill, but they were so short, the lot of  'em, that we concluded they must instead be kobolds. There were probably a dozen of 'em, and mostly armed judgin' by how they glinted, leading our hard work away from us. There weren't enough of us to stop 'em.'"

Chainmail makes it clear that dwarves absolutely *despise* goblins and kobolds, even suggesting that dwarves should *automatically charge* any goblins or kobolds within a given range with lethal intent. Jaddoc will naturally feel extreme distaste for these invaders. I'm curious, though, if this raid was a one time thing or not. It sounds like maybe it was a one off event, given that the backstory we were generating promptly ended after one attack. Grünfeld is going to keep the social influence going with the next question.

> Grünfeld, shaking his head: "I can't imagine the financial loss that moment represents. Have you seen kobolds on your land since?"

Let's ask our handy dandy oracle! I think it's pretty unlikely given the abrupt end to our situational backstory, but we'll leave it up to fate.

```
Has Jaddoc seen kobolds on his land since the initial raid?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Unlikely -2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 4 + 5 = 9 - 2 = 7, No
```

This makes sense to me. Has Jaddoc been trying to recover, maybe by bringing in new livestock to repopulate the ranch, but keeping them close to home for fear of giving his cows away again?

```
Has Jaddoc been repopulating his herd?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 6 + 7 = 13 + 2 = 15, Yes

Does Jaddoc keep them close to home?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 5 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

It's exactly as I expected then. I wonder if Jaddoc doesn't have some level of paranoia about kobolds in the hills looking down longingly at his cows.

```
Has Jaddoc seen kobolds spying on his ranch?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 +0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 7 = 17, Yes
```

> Jaddoc: "No, we haven't seen 'em since, but they can't be too far off. I can't tell if it were just a trick o' the light, but I could swear I saw somethin' atop one of the northern hills one evening. It could've been a kobold checkin' in to see if we've put cows back in the northern fields yet. 
>
> I've been tryin' ta get more cattle in, to keep the business goin', but I couldn't stand it to just hand 'em over to the vermin again. I've been playin' it slow, keepin' my cowsies close to home."

I think this would be a good moment for Grünfeld to try for the job. I'll try to make it really clear to Jaddoc that Grünfeld understands his problem. I'll treat the following dialogue as a social ability check, with Grünfeld attempting to come across as the right person for the job.

> Grünfeld: "I think it's a good call, keeping your livestock near the house for the time being. It sounds like these kobolds may be looking for easy targets and might avoid your house completely, but they'd probably be back soon if you let your cows roam.
>
> It also sounds to me like you're looking for more than hired hands to patrol and guard your land from kobolds indefinitely. You're looking for someone that can drive them out."

I'll test Grünfeld's Charisma now to determine whether he managed to influence Jaddoc at all with his delivery of these lines. Neither Chainmail nor OD&D includes rules for performing ability checks, so I found a supplementary article from [the first ever issue of Dragon magazine](https://annarchive.com/files/Drmg001.pdf) entitled "How to use Non-Prime Requisite Character Attributes" that gives the earliest ability check I've been able to find.

Dragon magazine is an official Dungeons & Dragons publication that's been around since the OD&D era. To be more specific, OD&D was first published in 1974, The Strategic Review (a precursor to Dragon) published its first volume in 1975, Dragon magazine published its first issue in 1976, and the first D&D Basic Set (Holmes Basic) was released in 1977. This indicates that any D&D article published between the release of OD&D and the D&D Basic Set could be considered either supplementary to OD&D or transitionary towards Basic D&D.

This particular article gives a really roundabout method for making ability checks that begins with rolling a d100 and adding the relevant ability score to determine which kind of die you'll get to roll with in the next step. Next, you roll the die you earned in the first step and multiply the result by the relevant ability score to get a percentage chance of success. Finally, you roll a d100 under the target number to see if you succeed or fail.

This is so deliciously unwieldy that I basically am required to use it as my procedure for ability checks throughout this campaign.

```
Grünfeld
CHA: 15

Ability Check, Charisma
d100 = 79 + 15 = 94, d12
d12 = 2! * 15 = 30%
d100 = 08!! Yes
```

Ohhhh my goodness, I was so shocked to roll a 2 in the second step for only a 30% chance of success, but then to roll an 8 under it for a success!! Wowww, that was such a crazy moment for me sitting here at the table. So Grünfeld will succeed in his attempt at social influence, which has a very specific meaning when you're using Simplified Behavior Checks. There's another Mythic Magazine article (also available in [Mythic Magazine Compilation #2](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/394527/mythic-magazine-compilation-2?affiliate_id=3556094)) called "RPG Social Skills With Mythic's Behavior Check" that breaks it down.

The first outcome is a shift in Jaddoc's Disposition. I can choose to apply either a +2 or -2 modifier, in effect either calming or inciting his mood. I think here we want Jaddoc to feel comfortable with our character's propositions, so I'll choose to reduce his Disposition by 2.

```
Jaddoc Disposition: 10, Passive
Social Skill Modifier: -2
Jaddoc New Disposition: 8, Passive
```

We're also changing the context of the discussion here. We were discussing what's happened on Jaddoc's land with the kobolds thus far, but now we're stepping into a discussion about finding a potential solution to his problem. This is exactly what Jaddoc wants and needs, so I imagine that he's really invested in this conversation. This makes me think that our Context Modifier should remain at +2, representing the conversation pushing Jaddoc towards action despite our social skill.

```
Jaddoc Context Modifier: +2
Jaddoc Modified Disposition: 8 + 2 = 10, Passive
```

Our successful Charisma Check has already had a tangible impact on the situation. Jaddoc's Modified Disposition has just shifted from Active to Passive, even given the new context for conversation. This is going to be great for future Behavior Checks. That's just mechanically, of course. Narratively, this represents Grünfeld disarming Jaddoc's paranoia ever so slightly.

Finally, when we roll the next Behavior Check to see how Jaddoc will respond, we can apply a modifier anywhere from -2 to +2 to our result, effectively giving us the ability to choose a result within a range on the NPC Action Table. No matter what range is available to choose from, Jaddoc's next action has to somehow incorporate what we want.

Altogether, these modifiers represent the benefits of success in social influence. I've found that it all works out really well in solo play. Let's make the final roll to see it in action.

```
Jaddoc Behavior Check
Disposition: 8
Context Modifier: +2
Modified Disposition: 8 + 2 = 10, Passive -2
2d10 = 9 + 7 = 16 - 2 = 14, Seeks to end the encounter
```

Our range of available results includes 'Gives Something', which to me could mean that Jaddoc is already prepared to give Grünfeld a job. I'll apply a Social Skill Modifier of -1 to make it happen.

```
Social Skill Modifier: -1 (Chosen)
Behavior Check = 14 - 1 = 13, Gives Something
```

> Jaddoc leans back in his seat, uncrossing his arms and resting one hand on the table. He, too, turns to look out the nearby window at a group of cows happily chewing cud.
>
> Jaddoc: "That's right, stranger. I want that piece of mind again that drew me to these hills in the first place."
>
> Jaddoc turns his head to face Grünfeld again.
>
> Jaddoc: "What do you propose?"

There are a few ways we could play this. Ultimately, I think we'll need to scout out where the kobolds live before we can come up with a plan for keeping them away from Jaddoc's farm. It would be useful, though, to first understand if Grünfeld's monster hunting background has granted him any special knowledge of Kobolds. His intelligence is below average, which will play against him here, but I'd still like to try for it just in case.

```
Grünfeld
INT: 8

Ability Check, Charisma
d100 = 18, d4
d4 = 4! * 8 = 32%
d100 = 57, No
```

You can only get so lucky, I suppose. So Grünfeld doesn't have any special knowledge of kobolds, but rather knows what anyone from that area might generally know about them. Does he know a guy, though? I think this is quite unlikely, and rather something we'll need to roleplay to find, but here goes nothing!

```
Does Grünfeld have a contact that can get him info about monsters?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Impossible -4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 4 = 14 - 4 = 10, No
```

Wowww that was so very close! But alas, Grünfeld has only his instincts as a monster hunter to rely on.

> Grünfeld: "Well, before trying anything serious, I'd first like to get the lay of your land. I'd want to scout out the kobolds to see if they have a lair nearby. It would be different if they had wandered here from further away. 
>
> I'm not especially familiar with how kobolds live and work, but if I could find and observe them for some short time, I'm confident that we could come up with a plan to remove them from the region. And, at any rate, this kind of information could prove valuable to you in defending your farm."

We already know that Jaddoc is going to give us a job, so let's see if it's for an initial scouting effort before forming a plan.

```
Does Jaddoc hire Grünfeld to scout the kobolds in the region?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 +0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 15, Yes
```

Very nice! OD&D gives us some guidance on handling hirelings or retainers that we could use to inform the price Jaddoc and Grünfeld agree to. According to Men & Magic we can hire retainers, becoming active members of our adventuring party, for around 100 gold pieces. I'm assuming that this amount of gold is good for about one expedition, which I'd say is an event lasting about one week.

This task is like a light expedition, so I'll guess that 80 gold pieces is more befitting of the situation. We can also infer that Jaddoc is watching his finances closely at the moment, given recent losses. I want to randomly determine the amount of gold Jaddoc offers based on this starting amount. I'll re-purpose the NPC Statistics Table from [Mythic GM Emulator 2e](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422929/mythic-game-master-emulator-second-edition?affiliate_id=3556094) for this.

```
Does Jaddoc offer Grünfeld 80 gold pieces?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 +0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 6 + 7 = 13, Yes
```

> Jaddoc: "That sounds like a good idea to me. If you can go out 'n' find where they live, and then report back with enough intelligence to inform a proper plan for their removal, then I'd gladly pay you 80 gold coins."

I don't think it would be too beneficial to haggle with Jaddoc here. I really want this job for Grünfeld to get a chance at exploring what the kobolds are like for pay, and we already know that Grünfeld himself is strapped for cash.

> Grünfeld: "I accept your terms."

Is there some kind of action here that indicates a social agreement, or a deal being struck, similar to shaking hands in our world? At the risk of creating something quite strange, I'll Discover Meaning on the Actions table for inspiration!

```
Discover Meaning, Actions
d100 = 89, Suppress
d100 = 61, Object
```

This makes me think that people here signal agreement by bowing, or lowering, something. I'll Discover Meaning on the Descriptions table to get a better sense of what that might be.

```
Discover Meaning, Descriptions
d100 = 93, Strangely
d100 = 95, Valuable
```

This is quite interesting! I'll replay the last few statements and roleplay my interpretation of the agreement.

> Jaddoc, digging into a pocket: "If you can go out 'n find where they live, and then report back..."
>
> Jaddoc produces a small clay oval with a design imprinted on one side, and places it on the table.
>
> Jadooc: "...with enough intelligence to inform a proper plan for their removal, then I'd gladly pay you 80 gold coins."
>
> Grünfeld, now digging into his own pockets: "I accept your terms."
>
> Grünfeld places a similar clay oval with a different design on the table, carefully placing it above Jaddoc's, nearer to Jaddoc than Grünfeld. Each man then grabs the clay token produced by the other, stashing them away in their own pockets.

I envision these clay tokens to represent debts and agreements between individuals. Perhaps there is a limit to the number of tokens each person has available to trade away, restricting the possibility for excessive divisions of loyalty. The opposite token is a reminder of the agreement. This is really cool!

> Grünfeld: "I'll get started right away. Would it be agreeable to you if I were to spend a night on your land? A barn loft would do, and I could set out on the morrow. I'll spend this evening gaining an understanding of your lands and their borders."

First, let's ask the Oracle if Jaddoc's barns have lofts where Grünfeld could sleep.

```
Do Jaddoc's barns have lofts?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 5 = 12 + 2 = 14, Yes
```

Next, let's make a Behavior Check for Jaddoc to see how he feels about this.

```
Jaddoc Behavior Check
Disposition: 8
Context Modifier: +2
Modified Disposition: 8 + 2 = 10, Passive -2
2d10 = 10 + 9 = 19 - 2 = 17, Takes Something
```

Oh wow, this makes me think that Jaddoc wants to nickel and dime Grünfeld into paying for his stay.

> Jaddoc, perking up at the thought of making money: "Well, if ye want to stay here at the ranch, I wouldn' mind rentin' a room out to ye. Board for the night would be a coin, and for the week would be four."

This has me chuckling in real life, but I get the feeling that Grünfeld won't take it so cheerfully.

> Grünfeld, dismissively: "Ah, I have no need for the undoubtably comfortable arrangements you could provide, friend. I'll set out at once and make camp where I find myself at dusk."
>
> Jaddoc, standing and pushing his chair back: "Very well, then, stranger. I sincerely look forward to the report of their situation on your return."
>
> Grünfeld, standing and bowing: "Good day, Jaddoc."

Is there some common deity they might agree on for providing good fortune?

```
Is there a mutual god of fortune?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 8 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12, Yes
```

I'll first roll to discover whether this is a god or goddess, and then for sounds on the Names table until something comes to mind.

```
Is this a goddess?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 +0
CF: 0 +0
2d10 = 3 + 3 = 6, No, Random Event

Discover Meaning, Names
d100 = 53, Mah
d100 = 23, Ei
d100 = 24, Ell
d100 = 97, Y
d100 = 61, Number
```

Perfect! This is Malix, god of fortune, and we've just triggered a random event! 

> Grünfeld, standing and bowing: "Good day, Jaddoc. Malix keep you."
>
> Jaddoc: "And you also!"

Let's generate the event!

```
Random Event Focus
d100 = 53, Move Toward a Thread
```

This is excellent! Technically we've recently closed our one open thread (woot!) to land the kobold removal job. I'm thinking that we should now add new threads to our list that represent Grünfeld's scouting job and search for the kobold lair.

```
Threads List
1-2 (Complete!) Land a kobold removal job from Jaddoc
3-4 Find the kobold lair
5-6 Report back to Jaddoc on kobolds in the region
```

Now that we've populated our Threads List with a new pair of threads, let's roll on it to select a focus for the Random Event.

```
Threads List Check
d10 = 4, Find the kobold lair
```

So this Random Event will somehow move Grünfeld forward towards finding the kobold lair. Let's Discover Meaning on the Actions table now to complete the Random Event.

```
Discover Meaning, Actions
d100 = 08, Attack
d100 = 95, Victory
```

I know just how to interpret this! We need to head back to where the kobolds had their first victory.

> Jaddoc, as he and Grünfeld walk towards the door: "You should probably start by searching the northeastern barn where we caught 'em sneakin' cowsies away. When we went back to inspect the damage, there were clear tracks leading away from the barn. The grass may have grown up around it all, but we've had nary much rain since then, so I'd imagine that a cavalcade o' cows wouldn't be too tough to track even yet."
>
> Grünfeld, as the front door is opened for him: "A fine piece of information. I'll head there at once."
>
> Grünfeld steps out into the open air, taking a deep breath.

I just have to know. Are there flowers in front of Jaddoc's farmhouse?

This feels like a perfect stopping point! In the next session I'll start using the [Randomized Location Crafter](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/382737/mythic-magazine-compilation-1?affiliate_id=3556094) to randomly generate Jaddoc's farm on the way to the site of cow thievery.
