Hail, and well met!

I use this space to document my solitary travels through the infinite worlds of tabletop roleplaying games. This blog captures session two of *The First Solo Chainmail Campaign*, where I'm using the [Mythic Game Master Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422929/mythic-game-master-emulator-second-edition?affiliate_id=3556094) to run an entirely solo [Original Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/28306/od-d-dungeons-dragons-original-edition-0e?affiliate_id=3556094) actual play using [Chainmail](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/17010/chainmail-rules-for-medieval-miniatures-0e?affiliate_id=3556094) to resolve combats!

This is a fairly detailed actual play. If you're new to the hobby, I want you to know that this level of detail is far from the typical notetaking that occurs during a solo roleplaying session. These actual plays are recorded in this format for entertainment purposes. Please don't feel compelled to spell everything out like I have, or even to take notes at all!

I sincerely hope you enjoy this collision of a modern solo roleplaying system with the original fantasy roleplaying game. Now, let's dive into the actual play! Happy delving, and **fight on!!**

# Session 2

When we last left Grünfeld, he was sitting in a dwarf's farmhouse kitchen trying to land a kobold removal job. Jaddoc, a former sapper (combat engineer) turned cattle rancher, is letting Grünfeld in on exactly what went down before he started looking for outside help. Now that I'm thinking about it, let's add this situation as our first Thread to the Threads List. In the same way that the Characters List provides Mythic with fuel for generating Random Events related to characters, the Threads List fuels Mythic with party goals that can be used later to form Random Events that help or hinder said goals.

```
Threads List
1-2 Land a kobold removal job from Jaddoc
```

We're randomly generating the backstory for Jaddoc's kobold situation using the Creating Compelling Backstories rules from [Mythic Magazine Compilation #2](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/394527/mythic-magazine-compilation-2?affiliate_id=3556094). As a reminder, we're rolling on the Backstory Focus Table until we either roll the Complete result or until we've rolled seven times. Each result becomes context for a string of events that tell the story behind Jaddoc's kobold incursion.

The first event we rolled was a New Thread with the word pair Flee, Investment. This word pair made me think that someone was out in the pastures working the cows when *something* forced them to abandon the herd. A Fate Question revealed that it was Jaddoc himself in the field on that day, when something exciting happened: we triggered the first Random Event of the campaign! Let's kick off the session by resolving it now!

To summarize, the current context is a flashback to Jaddoc in the fields at the moment when something happened that forced him to flee, leaving his herd behind.

```
Random Event Focus
d100 = 95, Current Context

Discover Meaning, Actions
d100 = 61, Misuse
d100 = 9, Building
```

Okay, so while Jaddoc was out with the cows he caught kobolds raiding a barn and trying to lead cows away! This Random Event pairs perfectly with the current Backstory Event we're working on.

```
Does Jaddoc have several barns spread across his property?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 6 = 13 + 4 = 17, Yes
```

That was really close to being our first exceptional yes,  but I'll settle for a just a yes. This tells me that Jaddoc could have been nearer to the edge of his slice of the hex and is potentially pretty far away from his house.

```
Did the kobolds spot him?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 1 = 11 + 2 = 13, Yes

Did they attack Jaddoc?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 + 0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 2 = 9, No

Was this initial contact very long ago? Maybe like a month or two ago?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 6 + 5 = 11 + 1 = 12, Yes

Did Jaddoc come across kobolds later in the evening, maybe near Sundown?
```

Both Chainmail and Original D&D describe kobolds as struggling to see and fight in full daylight, so I think it's almost a sure thing that kobolds would have waited until dusk before raiding farmlands.

```
Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 2 = 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

Now that Jaddoc is telling us an entire story, just for fun, let's roll for personality traits.

```
Discover Meaning, Character Personality
d100 = 59, Leader
d100 = 94, Tolerant
```

This result makes sense, given Jaddoc's position of leadership over a farming and ranching operation. I'll roll these results into the dialogue I imagine from Jaddoc.

> Jaddoc: “It'll be, let's see now, two months ago tomorrow, actually, that I was out herdin’ the cowsies ‘n’ we saw somethin’ funny going on at the northeast barn. 
>
> The barn doors were wide open 'fore we ever got there, and on the approach we noticed the cattle being led away by a group of, well, somethings! We weren't quite sure what they were at that point. 
>
> I was furious, o’ course, and we started rushin’ that way, but the little buggers started screeching and fired what I can only presume was a shot o’ warning. We heard the clanging of crossbows followed by the whistlin' of bolts, sounds that I couldn't mistake even if I wanted to, but everything fell short and we hightailed it outta there. My cowsies scrambled as we fled, but they managed to nab several more of 'em.”

Being from the south and having worked cattle myself, I am seriously enjoying writing cringe dialogue from Jaddoc the ranching dwarf's perspective. 

An interesting aspect of the rules from Generating Compelling Backstories is that your backstory has its own lists of threads and characters. I'll add a new Thread to our Backstory Threads List to account for the kobold's mission here.

```
Backstory Threads List
1-2 Kobolds: Steal Jaddoc's cattle
```

Let's move on now to the second backstory event. I'll roll again on the Backstory Focus Table and then Discover Meaning (roll for a word pair) on the Actions table to find out what happened next.

```
Backstory Event Focus
d100 = 87, Complete!
```

Just kidding! It looks like our backstory ends here, so I'll spend a few moments tying up loose ends with Fate Questions.

```
Did Jaddoc and his ranch hands scout the barn after fleeing to discover that the raiders were kobolds?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 9 + 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, Yes
```

This especially makes sense if the kobolds were too focused on their goal of stealing food to pursue the fleeing farmers.

> Jaddoc: "Once we realized that it wasn't us, but the cattle rather, that the little figures were chasin', we crested a hill and tried to get a good look at 'em."

Neither OD&D nor Chainmail describes or visualizes kobolds. In fact, each lumps kobolds together closely with goblins, for which no textual description of appearance is given, but we do have access to art portraying a goblin in OD&D!

![image-20240617143529839](C:\Users\Chris\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240617143529839.png)

Goblins appear very similarly to dwarves and kobolds can be inferred to be a smaller form of goblin. We can actually use Fate Questions to allow the Oracle to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about kobolds in this particular fantasy universe.

```
Are kobolds just smaller goblins?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 5 + 4= 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

As an aside, notice here that we've never ended the original scene. I'm treating this backstory as something Jaddoc is remembering while sitting with Grünfeld.

Because I've played RuneScape for most of my life, I usually envision goblins as being little green warlike creatures, similar in look and feel to orcs. Let's check to see if that's the case here.

```
Are goblins and kobolds green?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 10 = 20 + 1 = 21! Yes
```

This is an interesting Fate Check example because we rolled above the Exceptional Yes range of 18-20. The odds pushed our result one number past the exceptional range, leaving us with a regular Yes rather than an Exceptional Yes. We can infer then that our goblin and kobold friends are indeed shaded green. As another aside, there's a really good chapter on D&D and Chauvinism touching on the tendency of early roleplaying games to characterize adventurers as conquerors and enemy creatures as natives in the book [Muster: A Primer for War](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/413382/muster?affiliate_id=3556094).

> Jaddoc: "They looked like ruddy goblins to us from up on the hill, but they were so short, the lot of  'em, that we concluded instead they must be bloody kobolds. There were probably a dozen of them, armed, leading our hard work away from us. There weren't enough of us to stop"

Chainmail mentions that dwarves absolutely hate goblins and kobolds, even suggesting that dwarves should automatically charge goblins or kobolds within a given range. Jaddoc will naturally feel extreme distaste for these invaders. I'm curious, though, if this raid was a one time thing or not. It sounds like maybe it was, given that our backstory just ended. Grünfeld is going to keep the social influence going.

> Grünfeld, shaking his head: "I can't imagine the financial loss that moment represents. Have you seen kobolds on your land since?"

Let's ask our handy dandy oracle! I think it's pretty unlikely given the abrupt end to our situational backstory, but we'll leave it up to fate.

```
Has Jaddoc seen kobolds on his land since then initial raid?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Unlikely -2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 4 + 5 = 9 - 2 = 7, No
```

This makes sense to me. Has Jaddoc been trying to recover, maybe by bringing in new livestock to repopulate the ranch, but keeping them close to home for fear of giving his cows away again?

```
Has Jaddoc been repopulating his herd?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 6 + 7 = 13 + 2 = 15, Yes

Does Jaddoc keep them close to home?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 5 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

It's exactly as I expected then. I wonder if Jaddoc doesn't have some level of paranoia about kobolds in the hills looking down longingly at his cows.

```
Has Jaddoc seen kobolds spying on his ranch?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 +0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 7 = 17, Yes
```

> Jaddoc: "No, we haven't seen 'em since, but they can't be too far off. I can't tell if it were just a trick o' the light, but I could swear I saw somethin' atop one of the northern hills one evening. It could've been a kobold checkin' to see if we've put cows back in the northern fields. 
>
> I've been tryin' ta get more cattle in, to keep the business goin', but I couldn't stand it to just hand 'em over to the vermin again. I've been playin' it slow, keepin' my cowsies close to home."

I think this would be a good moment for Grünfeld to try for the job. I'll try to make it really clear to Jaddoc that Grünfeld understands his problem. I'll treat the following dialogue as a social ability check, with Grünfeld attempting to come across as the right person for the job.

> Grünfeld: "I think it's a good call, keeping your livestock near the house for the time being. It sounds like these kobolds may be looking for easy targets and might avoid your house completely, but they'd probably be back soon if you let your cows roam.
>
> It also sounds to me like you're looking for more than hired hands to patrol and guard your land from kobolds indefinitely. You want someone to drive them out for good."

I'll test Grünfeld's Charisma now to determine whether he managed to influence Jaddoc at all with his delivery of these lines. Neither Chainmail nor OD&D includes rules for performing ability checks, so I found a supplementary article from [the first ever issue of Dragon magazine](https://annarchive.com/files/Drmg001.pdf) entitled "How to use Non-Prime Requisite Character Attributes" that gives the earliest ability check I've been able to find.

Dragon magazine is an official Dungeons & Dragons publication that's been around since the OD&D era. To be more specific, OD&D was first published in 1974, The Strategic Review (a precursor to Dragon) published its first volume in 1975, Dragon magazine published its first issue in 1976, and the first D&D Basic Set (Holmes Basic) was released in 1977.

The article gives a really roundabout method for making ability checks that starts with rolling a d100 and adding the relevant ability score to determine which kind of die you get to roll in the next step. Next, you roll the die you earned in the first step and multiply the result by the relevant ability score to get a percentage chance of success. Finally, you roll a d100 under the target number to see if you succeed or fail.

This is so deliciously unwieldy that I basically am required to use it as my procedure for ability checks throughout the campaign.

```
Grünfeld
CHA: 15

Ability Check
d100 = 79 + 15 = 94, d12
d12 = 2! * 15 = 30%
d100 = 08!! Yes
```
