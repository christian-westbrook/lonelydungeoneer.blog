Hail, and well met!

I use this space to document my solitary travels through the infinite worlds of tabletop roleplaying games. This blog captures session two of *The First Solo Chainmail Campaign*, where I'm using the [Mythic Game Master Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422929/mythic-game-master-emulator-second-edition?affiliate_id=3556094) to run an entirely solo [Original Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/28306/od-d-dungeons-dragons-original-edition-0e?affiliate_id=3556094) actual play using [Chainmail](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/17010/chainmail-rules-for-medieval-miniatures-0e?affiliate_id=3556094) to resolve combats!

This is a fairly detailed actual play. If you're new to the hobby, I want you to know that this level of detail is far from the typical notetaking that occurs during a solo roleplaying session. These actual plays are recorded in this format for entertainment purposes. Please don't feel compelled to spell everything out like I have, or even to take notes at all!

I sincerely hope you enjoy this collision of a modern solo roleplaying system with the original fantasy roleplaying game. Now, let's dive into the actual play! Happy delving, and **fight on!**!

# Session 2

When we last left Grünfeld, he was sitting in a dwarf's farmhouse kitchen trying to land a kobold removal job. Jaddoc, a former sapper (combat engineer) turned cattle rancher, is letting Grünfeld in on exactly what went down before he started looking for outside help. Now that I'm thinking about it, let's add this situation as our first Thread to the Threads List. In the same way that the Characters List provides Mythic with fuel for generating Random Events related to characters, the Threads List fuels Mythic with party goals that can be used later to form Random Events that help or hinder said goals.

```
Threads List
1-2 Land a kobold removal job from Jaddoc
```

We're randomly generating the backstory for Jaddoc's kobold situation using the Creating Compelling Backstories rules from [Mythic Magazine Compilation #2](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/394527/mythic-magazine-compilation-2?affiliate_id=3556094). As a reminder, we're rolling on the Backstory Focus Table until we either roll the Complete result or until we've rolled seven times. Each result becomes context for a string of events that tell the story behind Jaddoc's kobold incursion.

The first event we rolled was a New Thread with the word pair Flee, Investment. This word pair made me think that someone was out in the pastures working the cows when *something* forced them to abandon the herd. A Fate Question revealed that it was Jaddoc himself in the field on that day, when something exciting happened: we triggered the first Random Event of the campaign! Let's kick off the session by resolving it now!

To summarize, the current context is a flashback to Jaddoc in the fields at the moment when something happened that forced him to flee, leaving his herd behind.

```
Random Event Focus
d100 = 95, Current Context

Discover Meaning, Actions
d100 = 61, Misuse
d100 = 9, Building
```

Okay, so while Jaddoc was out with the cows he caught kobolds raiding a barn and trying to lead cows away! This Random Event pairs perfectly with the current Backstory Event we're working on.

```
Does Jaddoc have several barns spread across his property?

Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 6 = 13 + 4 = 17, Yes
```

That was really close to being our first exceptional yes,  but I'll settle for a just a yes. This tells me that Jaddoc could have been nearer to the edge of his slice of the hex and is potentially pretty far away from his house.

```
Did the kobolds spot him?

Fate Check
Odds: Very Likely +2
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 10 + 1 = 11 + 2 = 13, Yes

Did they attack Jaddoc?

Fate Check
Odds: 50/50 + 0
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 2 = 9, No

Was this initial contact very long ago? Maybe like a month or two ago?

Fate Check
Odds: Likely +1
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 6 + 5 = 11 + 1 = 12, Yes

Did Jaddoc come across kobolds later in the evening, maybe near Sundown?
```

Both Chainmail and Original D&D describe kobolds as struggling to see and fight in full daylight, so I think it's almost a sure thing that kobolds would have waited until dusk before raiding farmlands.

```
Fate Check
Odds: Nearly Certain +4
CF: 5 +0
2d10 = 7 + 2 = 9 + 4 = 13, Yes
```

Now that Jaddoc is telling us an entire story, just for fun, let's roll for personality traits.

```
Discover Meaning, Character Personality
d100 = 59, Leader
d100 = 94, Tolerant
```

This result makes sense, given Jaddoc's position of leadership over a farming and ranching operation. I'll roll these results into the dialogue I imagine from Jaddoc.

> Jaddoc: “It'll be, let's see now, two months ago tomorrow, actually, that I was out herdin’ the cowsies ‘n’ we saw somethin’ funny going on at the northeast barn. 
>
> The barn doors were wide open 'fore we ever got there, and on the approach we noticed the cattle being led away by a group of, well, somethings! We weren't quite sure what they were at that point. 
>
> I was furious, o’ course, and we started rushin’ that way, but the little buggers started screeching and fired what I can only presume was a shot o’ warning. We heard the clanging of crossbows followed by the whistlin' of bolts, sounds that I couldn't mistake even if I wanted to, but everything fell short and we hightailed it outta there. My cowsies scrambled as we fled, but they managed to nab several more of 'em.”

Being from the south and having worked cattle myself, I am seriously enjoying writing cringe dialogue from Jaddoc the ranching dwarf's perspective. 

An interesting aspect of the rules from Generating Compelling Backstories is that your backstory has its own lists of threads and characters. I'll add a new Thread to our Backstory Threads List to account for the kobold's mission here.

```
Backstory Threads List
1-2 Kobolds: Steal Jaddoc's cattle
```

Let's move on now to the second backstory event.
